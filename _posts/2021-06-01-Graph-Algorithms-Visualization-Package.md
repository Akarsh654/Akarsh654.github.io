After learning Graph Algorithms in CMPUT 204 I was excited to implement them and I decided to create a Python Package which aims to create visual outputs for popular Graph Algorithms..  
So far the package includes Breadth First Search (BFS), Depth First Search (DFS) and Topological Sort. I will continue implementing and adding more algorithms like Prim's and Kruskal's   
algorithm for MST, A* Search etc.  


It is not just limited to getting a visual output, but the algorithms will be optimised by using heuristics for non-polynomial time algorithms.   
This project aims to create a better understanding of the working of graph algorithms, improve the computation time and optimising the algorithms.  
It could be used by analysts as well as students and teachers, as a teaching aid.

The full code can be found on my (GitHub repository)[https://github.com/Akarsh654/Graph-Algorithms-Package] and the package can be viewed on (Pypi)[https://pypi.org/project/graph-algo-vis/0.2/#description]  

To run the package: pip install graph-algo-vis
