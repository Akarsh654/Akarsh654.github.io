This academic year (2021-2022) I was the president of the Google Developer Student Club, and in the winter semester I led and managed a project to create a discord bot 
that posts internships and job postings based on user preferences (location, job keywords). Furthermore, the bot has a notification feature where it
can notify the user of new job postings based on the notification interval provided by the user.   

I led a team of 7 and held weekly meetings and used SCRUM practices. I initially divided the teams into 3 - Database team, WebScraping team and Bot Configuration team.
We scraped jobs from Indeed and LinkedIn and stored the postings in a sql database. 

The full code can be found at (GitHub)[https://github.com/Google-DSC-UAlberta/Discord-Bot]
