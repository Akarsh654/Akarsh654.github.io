As the student lead of the Google Developer Student Club, this winter semester I led and managed a project to create a discord bot 
that posts internships and job postings based on user preferences (location, job keywords). Furthermore, the bot has a notification feature where it
can notify the user of new job postings based on the notification interval provided by the user.
