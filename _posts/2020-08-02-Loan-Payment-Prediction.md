For this project I will be exploring publicly available data from LendingClub.com. [Lending Club](https://www.lendingclub.com/) connects people who need money (borrowers) with people who have money (investors).
Hopefully, as an investor you would want to invest in people who showed a profile of having a high probability of paying you back. I creatde a model that will help predict this.
I used lending data from 2007-2010 and be trying to classify and predict whether or not the borrower paid back their loan in full. 
The jupyternotebook is shown below.
