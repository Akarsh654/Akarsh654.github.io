On 15 April 1912, Titanic, the largest ship of its time, sank after hitting an iceberg in the North Atlantic Ocean. Of the 2,224 people estimated on board, only 705 survived.
This study uses data analysis, feature engineering and machine learning techniques to analyze the survivability of passengers on board of the Titanic.
I trained the model using both R programming language and Python and achieved approximately 80% accuracy.
