This January I took part in the HackED 2021, Alberta's Largest Student Run Hackathon. I worked in a team of 4 with [Tanyaradzwa Gozhora](https://devpost.com/TanyaradzwaGozhora), [Abeer Waheed](https://devpost.com/amir-waheed) and [David Jacinth](https://devpost.com/davidjacinth).   
It is evident that due to online learning, university students are unable to connect with their peers in their classes as much. This is why my friends and I decided to design   
a website whereby UAlberta students can fill in their discord usernames and the courses they are taking. Then they will be mathched with the top 5 students taking similar courses  
as them and they shall be granted their discord handles. This way students in similar classes can make new friends online.   

For this project we used HTML, CSS and Javascript for the frontend and NodeJS for the backend and MongoDB to handle the database. We had to come up with an algorithm that can  
match a student with 5 others instantly when they fill in the form. The search and matching was optimized by creating MongoDB indexes and the form to be filled  
was designed in a way that students can add upto 6 courses. We used Google Authentication to ensure that only students with ualberta email addresses can signup and fill the form.  

The hackathon was for 24 hours and we ran out of time to host the website and set up the database connection to an online cloud server. However we plan to launch it soon!  
Furthermore, we plan to extend this website such that it can work for all universities in Canada.
